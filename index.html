        Patriot Front is the fastest growing and most active white supremacist group in the United States. The secretive group does not disclose their size, but they do distribute flyers.

      <p>
        Flyers require time, labor, money, and most importantly – people – to create and to distribute. In April 2020, the group distributed 12 times more flyers than they did during the same month in 2018.

        For some, flyers from white supremacists in their neighborhood feel like a threat. For others, they’re an invitation. <br><br>
        “Members are barred from holding membership with any rival organization and must regularly engage in activism — such as posting flyers in their local communities — or risk expulsion,” explained Southern Poverty Law Center.<br><br>
        Patriot Front broke off from Vanguard America after the Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally in 2017. In August, Rousseau and two other men were arrested in Weatherford, Texas for placing stickers on county property.<br><br>
